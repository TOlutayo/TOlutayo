- 👋 Hi, I’m @TOlutayo
- 👀 I’m interested in Machine learning and wireless communications
- 🌱 I’m currently learning how to applying probablistic generative models for symbol detection in Massive MIMO systems
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that intersect deep learning with solving wireless physical layer problems such as channel estimation, symbol detection, channel coding, etc.
- 📫 You can reach me via email at toluwaleke.olutayo@mail.mcgill.ca
